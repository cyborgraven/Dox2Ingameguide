Pygmy Prime and Pygmy Mega (PP/PM) traits are random rolled values based on the Pygmys drag weight.

So a pygmy could take  2 pygmy kibble or it could take 20 pygmy kibble.  Simply stand next to a pygmy and it will take the kibble from your hotbar automatically and either SUCCEED or FAIL w a displayed notification alerting you.  \n\n\n<RichColor Color=\"0,1,1,1\">Alternatively Pygmys can also be created from any Dox creature by feeding it EVO kibble</>.  With several types of Evo kibble available to players, the odds of getting good Pygmys varies.
